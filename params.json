Sqribe makes it easy to focus on small sections of music at a time, and allows you to listen to your notated music in time with the original recording. These features make transcription more accessible; with some trial and error you can often determine the notes without requiring a masterful musical ear.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can reach the author via email: sqweek@gmail.com",
